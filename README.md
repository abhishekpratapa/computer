# Computer

In this repository I'm going to be designing a computer from scratch using Verilog, starting from the transistors. It's probably not going to follow any architecture like x86 or arm, but its to understand the principles of how a computer works. If I use a high level element like a register or gates like and and or gates, they'll only be used in the `test_bench` or `*_tb.v` files for testing. If I use these high level elements in the components, I will have likely alreay implemented the component in transistors and hopefully I'll leave a comment specifying that, we'll see, hahaha.


# Components

## Getting Started

- [x] hello world - Getting setup with Verilog
- [x] counter - Making a simple counter in Verilog

## Gates

- [x] not gate
- [ ] or gate
- [ ] nor gate
- [ ] xor gate
- [ ] and gate
- [ ] nand gate
